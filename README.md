# Game Time Tracker - an Overwolf application

Yet another time tracking app for Overwolf!

Available at https://www.overwolf.com/app/NoLifeKing85-Game_Time_Tracker

.. no but seriously, we'll try and track all time you spend in games and give you some sweet stats for it. :)

## Planned features

- Keep track of APM/KPM for each session
- Be able to go back and compare sessions with each other
- Keep track of what games you have streamed (only if I detect it properly)
- Don't know what to play? Ask the application and it'll suggest a game that you usually play around the given time and day (will only be able to suggest from the games detected ^^;)

## In progress

- Track other games than Overwolf has support for

## Completed features

- Track each session of each game (supported by Overwolf, will try to add support for other games as well!)
- Give you stats on what game you play the most
- Graphs, everyone loves graphs.. right? ^^
